gRPC Support
============

Support for using NI-DCPower over gRPC

.. py:currentmodule:: nidcpower



SessionInitializationBehavior
-----------------------------

.. py:class:: SessionInitializationBehavior

    .. py:attribute:: SessionInitializationBehavior.AUTO


        The NI gRPC Device Server will attach to an existing session with the specified name if it exists,
        otherwise the server will initialize a new session.

        .. note:: When using the Session as a context manager and the context exits, the behavior depends on what happened when the constructor
            was called. If it resulted in a new session being initialized on the NI gRPC Device Server, then it will automatically close the
            server session. If it instead attached to an existing session, then it will detach from the server session and leave it open.


    .. py:attribute:: SessionInitializationBehavior.INITIALIZE_SERVER_SESSION


        Require the NI gRPC Device Server to initialize a new session with the specified name.

        .. note:: When using the Session as a context manager and the context exits, it will automatically close the
            server session.


    .. py:attribute:: SessionInitializationBehavior.ATTACH_TO_SERVER_SESSION


        Require the NI gRPC Device Server to attach to an existing session with the specified name.

        .. note:: When using the Session as a context manager and the context exits, it will detach from the server session
            and leave it open.



GrpcSessionOptions
------------------


.. py:class:: GrpcSessionOptions(self, grpc_channel, session_name, initialization_behavior=SessionInitializationBehavior.AUTO)


    Collection of options that specifies session behaviors related to gRPC.

    Creates and returns an object you can pass to a Session constructor.


    :param grpc_channel:
        

        Specifies the channel to the NI gRPC Device Server.

        

    :type grpc_channel: grpc.Channel


    :param session_name:
        

        User-specified name that identifies the driver session on the NI gRPC Device Server.

        This is different from the resource name parameter many APIs take as a separate
        parameter. Specifying a name makes it easy to share sessions across multiple gRPC clients.
        You can use an empty string if you want to always initialize a new session on the server.
        To attach to an existing session, you must specify the session name it was initialized with.

        

    :type session_name: str


    :param initialization_behavior:
        

        Specifies whether it is acceptable to initialize a new session or attach to an existing one, or if only one of the behaviors is desired.

        The driver session exists on the NI gRPC Device Server.

        

    :type initialization_behavior: :py:data:`nidcpower.SessionInitializationBehavior`
